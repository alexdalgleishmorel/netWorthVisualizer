# netWorthVisualizer
Gives a real time net-worth value to the user, along with basic stock analytics and buy/sell history. All based on the assets declared on the excel spreadsheet.

Ensuring the following libraries are installed on your computer:
1 --> pandas
2 --> matplotlib
3 --> yfinance
If not then, if on Windows, run command "pip install <library>". For example: pip install pandas
  
Goals are to ultimately have this running 24/7 on Rasberry Pi, displaying networth on some sort of display.
